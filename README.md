# bash.sh

`bash.sh` is a starter template for shell developing.

![image-20250711132419515](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hzimg/blog-pics@master/upgit/2025/07/20250711_1752211477.png)

File `bash.config` can be applied and sourced into your zshell environment directly. See [Import bash.config into your zsh env](#3-import-bashconfig-into-your-zsh-env). This will allow loading any tools lazily and automatically from `$HOME/.local/bin/ops.d/{lazy,apt,yum,zypper,ubuntu,opensuse-leap,...}`.

## Features

We devote ourselves to helping you to write shell script functions more easier.

- Write lots of functions and make calling them easier
- Write many functions and organize them hierarchically
- Work for multiple devops environments: making `ops` command and its subcommands; decorating your local zshell init scripts for managing the useful utilities.

## History

## Usages

### Command Line Options

```bash
# internal commands
$ ./bash.sh cool
$ ./bash.sh sleep

# see debug-info (environment checks)
$ DEBUG=1 ./bash.sh
$ ./bash.sh debug-info

# internal helpers
$ ./bash.sh 'is_root && echo Y'
$ sudo ./bash.sh 'is_root && echo Y'
$ sudo DEBUG=1 ./bash.sh 'is_root && echo y'

# at end of the execution
$ HAS_END=: ./bash.sh
$ HAS_END=false ./bash.sh
```

### Use It

#### 1. Simple

Copy [bash.sh](bash.sh) and rename as your main entry (such as: `mgr`), and go ahead.

> Modify `_my_main_do_sth()` as you want.

Example:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hedzr/bash.sh/master/bash.sh
mv bash.sh installsamba
DEBUG=1 ./installsamba
```

#### 2. Global

##### Use `installer`

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/hedzr/bash.sh/raw/refs/heads/master/installer | bash -s
```

> `installer` will copy `bash.config` to `~/.local/bin/bash.sh`.
>
> `installer` makes a symbolic link `ops` to `bash.config`, you can run the builtin functions with it:
> try `ops debug-info` to ensure it works.

##### Manually

Copy `bash.config` to `/usr/local/bin/` or anywhere you prefer, and `source` it from your script file.

Some examples [here](./examples/).

#### 3. Import `bash.config` into your zsh env

You may import `bash.config` into your local zshell environment. This brings a extensible structure to you: the bash.sh loader (in `darwin-only.sh`) will source in the scripts at these places (macOS only):

1. `/path/to/bash.sh/ops.d/*.sh`
2. `/path/to/bash.sh/ops.d/{darwin,windows,ubuntu,...}/*.sh`
3. `/path/to/bash.sh/ops.d/{brew,apt,dnf,yum,...}*.sh`
4. `$HOME/.local/bin/.zsh/*.sh`

Since we shipped `bash.sh` with `./ops.d/darwin/*.sh`, so the
features above will be available. As an extra feature, `Lazy loading`
machanism is available too. Just put your .sh tool
into this folder:

1. `$HOME/.local/bin/.zsh/lazy/`
1. `$HOME/.local/bin/ops.d/lazy/*.sh`

It will be loaded and invoked on-demand.

> As a sample, you could save [`vm.sh`](https://gist.github.com/hedzr/ea2626fb290e5ca74687967d0d768cdb) into `~/.local/bin/.zsh`,
> and save [`vagrant_run.sh`](https://gist.github.com/hedzr/a24592879ac90239be6c8b1746feebd4) into `~/.local/bin/.zsh/lazy`,
> and run it:
>
> ```bash
> vm ls
> vm run u20s.local
> vm sizes
> ```
>
> function `vm` (in vm.sh) will be invoked directly, and
> function `vagrant_run` will be lazy-loaded and invoked
> implicitly.
>
> Do same action on [`vmware_run.sh`](https://gist.github.com/hedzr/956cb892069b0353f915b395a9504ebf).
>
> We have serveral posts in chinese to introduce `vm()` ([HERE](https://hedzr.com/devops/linux/manage-vms-from-command-line/)).

##### How?

Put these codes in your `$HOME/.zshenv`(or `$HOME/.bashrc`):

```bash
### BASH.SH/.CONFIG ####################################
{
  f="/path/to/bash.sh/bash.config"
  [ -f "$f" ] && DEBUG=1 VERBOSE=0 source "$f" >>/tmp/sourced.list
  unset cool sleeping _my_main_do_sth main_do_sth dir f DEBUG VERBOSE currentShell
}
### BASH.SH/.CONFIG END ################################
```

It can be simplified to one-liner:

```bash
. "/path/to/bash.sh/bash.config" && unset cool sleeping _my_main_do_sth main_do_sth DEBUG VERBOSE currentShell
```

### Write functions and call them

First of `bash.sh` is, we collected and organized many small functions and utilities to build a basic framework so you can pass the writing about entry point and arguments parsing, and so on.

Which means, you're working for checking how many nodes are online, you may write `count_nodes()` function in a blank script file `count-nodes.sh`, and append the fragment between `#### HZ Tail BEGIN ####` and `#### HZ Tail END ####` from file `bash.sh`.

```bash
count_nodes() {
  local count="$#"
  echo "nodes count is $count, they are: $@"
}
```

Now you have a highly extensible script, it'll be used as:

```bash
# call your count_nodes()
$ ./count-nodes.sh count_nodes
# call it with arguments
$ ./count-nodes.sh count_nodes rabbit.ops.local
```

Any arguments will be passed into count-nodes.

It's highly extensible. You may add second function `enter_node` in it:

```bash
enter_node() {
  local node="$1"
  echo "entering $node ..., $@"
}
```

Call it is simple:

```bash
$ ./count-nodes.sh enter_nodes redis.ops.local 1 2 3
entering redis.ops.local ..., 1 2 3
```

### Use `commander()` in your scripts

`commander` make writing multi-level subcommands simple. It assumes first argument as subcommand and try invoking the responsed function by join the subcommand to current command. So `dns add` is same of invoking `dns_add`.

Here is a example codes in an `ops`:

```bash
dns() {
 dns_entry() { commander $(strip_r $(fn_name) _entry) "$@"; }
 dns_usage() {
  cat <<-EOF
   Usage: $0 $self <sub-command> [...]
   Sub-commands:
     ls [--all|-a|--cname|--txt|--one|-1] [string]   list all/most-of-all/generics matched dns-records
     dump                    [RESERVED] dump dns-records [just for dns01]
     nsupdate                [DNS] [DYN] [MODIFY]
     fix_nameservers         [ali] general fix nameservers, step 1
     vpc_fix                 [ali] for VPC envir
     profile                 [ali] make a query perf test and report
     check                   [ali] check dns query is ok [version 1]
     check_2                 [ali] check dns query is ok [version 2]
     check_resolv_conf       [ali] check resolv.conf is right

   Examples:
     $ ops dns ls          # just print the pyhsical ECS' A records
     $ ops dns ls --all
     $ ops dns ls --cname
     $ ops dns ls --txt
     $ ops dns ls sw0
     $ ops dns nsupdate-add sw0ttt00 10.0.24.30
     $ ops dns nsupdate-del sw0ttt00
     $ ops dns nsupdate-add mongo cname mgo.ops.local
     $ ops dns nsupdate-del mongo cname

  EOF
 }

 dns_check() {
  echo "dns check"
 }
 dns_check_2() {
  echo "dns check 2"
 }
 dns_ls() { :; }
 dns_dump() { echo dump dns; }
 dns_nsupdate() { :; }
 dns_ls() { :; }
 dns_vpc_fix() { :; }
 dns_profile() { :; }
 dns_check_resolv_conf() { :; }

 # sub of sub-commands
 #dns_fix()        { dns_entry "$@"; }
 dns_fix_entry() { commander $(strip_r $(fn_name) _entry) "$@"; }
 dns_fix_usage() {
  cat <<-EOF
   Usage: $0 $self <sub-command> [...]
   Sub-commands:
     nameservers             [ali] general fix nameservers, step 1
     resolv_conf             [ali] for VPC envir

   Examples:
     $ ops dns fix nameservers
     $ ops dns fix resolv_conf

  EOF
 }
 dns_fix_nameservers() { echo dns_fix_nameservers; }
 dns_fix_resolv_conf() { echo dns_fix_resolv_conf; }

 dns_entry "$@"
}
```

and the usage of `ops` command will be:

```bash
ops dns ls
ops dns check
ops dns check_2
ops dns dump

# sub of sub-commands
ops dns fix nameservers
ops dns fix resolv_conf
ops dns fix_nameservers
ops dns fix-nameservers
```

### Write a lazy function

The best practice of writing a lazy function is, you should
create two functions:
 one is auto-imported, such as a name `autocmd`, and the
 two is lazy, named as `autocmd-lazy`.

The script file `autocmd.sh` of the first function be put
into `~/.local/bin/.zsh/`, that's one of auto-loading location.
The file `autocmd-lazy.sh` be put into `~/.local/bin/.zsh/lazy`,
this is the lazy loading folder for its upper directory.

The script codes are:

```bash
# autocmd.sh
autocmd() { autocmd_lazy "$@"; }
# in its body, calling to `autocmd-lazy` will trigger a unhandled
# function name event, so our lazy-loader can capture and try 
# loading autocmd-lazy.sh or autocmd_lazy.sh in `lazy` folders.
```

And its real body is:

```bash
# autocmd-lazy.sh
autocmd_lazy() {
  : # your implementations here
}
```

Why we split a lazy function into two implementations?

Because the first function auto-imported, `autocmd`, can be recoganized with
zsh command container in .zshrc initializing phrase.
**So it is visible at typing command characters on zsh command-line**. That
means, zsh-autocompletion, autosuggestions
and others machanisms can work properly.

At same time, its body is so tiny so it doesn't waste too much in zsh initializing time.

And the really implementation of `autocmd` was been moved into
`autocmd-lazy` function, it will be loaded until user typed
`autocmd<ENTER>` at first time.

### Like Kebab style?

A classical bash composer would be like kebab naming as function names.

```bash
# bash only
function cleanup-homebrew() {
  :
}
```

But it's invalid name in zsh env. It's sadly.

Fortunately, there is a way to keep kebab name working in zsh: alias. So
you may make a copy of a standard zsh function:

```bash
# for both bash and zsh
function cleanup_homebrew() {
  :
}
alias cleanup-homebrew=cleanup_homebrew
```

That's a trick!

## Knives Document

### `in_debug`

in debug mode?

toggle environment variable `DEBUG` to switch between `normal_mode` and `debug_mode`.

```bash
is_debug && echo 'debug mode' || echo 'normal mode'
```

### `debug` $\*, `dbg`, `tip`, `err`

Prints string as darker text for debugging (if env var `DEBUG` == 1). In normal mode, the string message will be stripped.

```bash
debug I am buggy but you don't know
debug 'I am buggy but you don'''t know'
debug "I am buggy but you don't know"

dbg "debug line"

tip "A simple message to tip you something happened: $event"
err "Error occurred whlie executed the command line: $cmd '$@'"
```

- `tip` and `err` will always prints message.
- `err` will prints message to stderr device.
- `dbg` available on DEBUG=1, it's slight differant with `debug`

You may use the splitted version: `debug_begin` and `debug_end`:

```bash
if ((DEBUG)); then
  debug_begin
  cat /etc/os_release # this file will be printed with darker color.
  debug_end
fi
```

### `headline` $\*

print a hilight message string.

```bash
headline here is the hilighted title
```

### `is_bash` & `is_zsh`

check if running under bash/zsh interpretor or not

```bash
is_bash && echo 'in bash'
is_zsh && echo 'in zsh'
```

### `is_linux`, `is_darwin`

check if running in Linux/macOS shell.

```bash
is_linux && echo 'in linux'
is_darwin && grep -E 'LISTEN|UDP' somefile || grep -P 'LISTEN|UDP' somefile
```
